# Muting your microphone
This is not as easy as play/pause, and requires some setup on your machine.  and for Windows it requires AutoHotKey or some other method of mapping custom keyboard inputs. This is built into OSX already.  See below.

I have provided a script that will mute your microphone, but you will have to adjust the ID for your microphone mixer.  More later.

`Ctrl + Alt + Shift + ;` is the shortcut that will be sent when pushing the "Mute" button (clicking the volume knob)


# Set up global mic mute for Windows
Get [AutoHotKey](https://www.autohotkey.com/). Run the .ahk file provided in this repo.  Adjust the ID for the input mixer to match your system. You can obtain this ID by running the other AHK file provided.
